# Project 2: Website with a Search Engine

### Overveiw of the Project

By creating this code I made a website that uses an in-site search bar to look up GIF's. This code also makes it so that the website has the ability to pull up random GIF's at the click of a button.

### Technologies Utilized

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap
4. Javascript
5. API

### User Stories

1. As a user, I wanted to be able to get random GIF's.
2. As a Teacher, I want a website that will let me view multiple GIF's one page at a time
3. As a Grandma, I want to be able to search for the perfect GIF for my granddaughters birthday.

### Ideas for Future Improvement

1. Add a way to view picture up close in the website itself
2. Add a way for people to upload their own photos
